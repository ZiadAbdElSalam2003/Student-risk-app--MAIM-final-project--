# 🎓 Student Risk App

A prototype web application that helps schools and teachers detect and address student risks early.

The app predicts **student risk levels (High / Medium / Low)** in **Portuguese** and **Math** using ML models, and performs **feedback sentiment analysis** to understand opinions from students and parents.

The interface is built with **Flask** for simple, user-friendly access by teachers and school administrators.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Risk Prediction:**

  * Portuguese: Random Forest
  * Math: Decision Tree
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Pre-trained NLP model for analyzing student/parent feedback.
* **Flask Web Demo:** Easy-to-use prototype for non-technical users.
* **End-to-End Pipeline:** From data cleaning & preprocessing → model training & evaluation → deployment in a demo app.
